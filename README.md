# Collateral Manager  
Collateral on the blockchain incurs huge opportunity costs by requiring capital that could be put to productive use elsewhere to be held in smart contracts in whatever currency the smart contract developer has decided to require. This forces users to hold their capital in what they are likely to view as sub-optimal assets, given the large (and growing) number of assets available on the blockchain and the fact that it is typically only feasible for smart contracts to accept a single asset as collateral.  
  
This is far different from the way that collateral works in everyday life, at least in most developed countries. Off-chain collateral is able to live a "double life" by serving to secure debt or other guarantees while also being utilized for the property's initial purpose, as in the case of a mortgage which allows you to live in your house while it serves as collateral, or for the purpose of gaining interest on the collateral itself, as in the case of collateral for margin trading which can be held in the form of whichever securities the user believes has the highest expected return on invested capital.  

This leveraging of personal property to serve a "double life" as collateral is arguably the single most important ingredient in the growth of a successful capitalist economy, an idea that is explored in Hernando de Soto's book, The Mystery of Capital. Off chain, the challenge is often finding a way to fix an asset's economic potential so that it can also serve as collateral. On the blockchain, the challenge is finding a way to allow collateral to also serve as an asset. This is already the case if the smart contract you want to use happens to require collateral to be held in the exact asset that you believe to provide the maximum return on your capital. However, this is an increasingly unlikely scenario as the number of assets available on chain grows and the risk profiles of these assets become significantly more diverse (think highly speculative ICO tokens vs. DAI or synthetic assets derived from real-world government bonds).  
  
The goal of this project is to create a system that smart contracts can use to manage collateral and pay out in any asset that fits their use case. At the same time, users can manage their own capital that is being held as collateral and invest it in any on-chain asset that they choose. As long as the value of the user's held assets stay above the value of the required collateral (+ some collateralization ratio), the user is free to use their capital as they choose. If, in the future, ownership of off-chain assets is successfully tied to on-chain ownership of representations of those assets (such as the tokenization of a home in a way that guarantees the token holder is also in physical possession of the home), then this same system could be used to allow off-chain property to serve as collateral on chain while also being utilized for the property's initially intended purpose (e.g. living in the home).
